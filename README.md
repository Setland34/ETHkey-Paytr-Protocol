# ETHkey Paytr Protocol

This repository contains the ETHkey Paytr Protocol, a protocol for secure and efficient transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Overview and Key Features

The ETHkey Paytr Protocol is designed to provide secure and efficient transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Key features include:
- Ethereum key generation and management
- Paytr protocol implementation for secure transactions
- Modular design for easy maintenance and extension

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:Setland34/ETHkey-Paytr-Protocal.git
   cd ETHkey-Paytr-Protocal
   ```

2. Install Node.js and npm:
   Follow the instructions on the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) to install Node.js and npm.

3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure environment variables (if needed):
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. For example:
   ```sh
   API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

5. Start the project:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

6. Build the project:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

7. Run tests:
   ```sh
   npm test
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup or usage, please refer to the following troubleshooting tips:

2. Check that all dependencies are installed correctly by running `npm install` again.
3. Verify that your environment variables are set up correctly in the `.env` file.
4. Consult the project's issue tracker on GitHub for any known issues and their solutions.

## Usage Examples and API Documentation

### Generating an Ethereum Key
```js
const { generateKey } = require('./src/ethkey');
const key = generateKey();
console.log('Generated Ethereum Key:', key);
```

### Creating a Paytr Transaction
```js
const { createTransaction } = require('./src/paytr');
const transaction = createTransaction({ from: '0x...', to: '0x...', value: 100 });
console.log('Created Paytr Transaction:', transaction);
```

## Running Tests and Interpreting Results

To run the tests, use the following command:
```sh
npm test
```
The test results will be displayed in the terminal. Ensure that all tests pass before submitting any changes.
