# ETHkey Paytr Protocol

This repository contains the ETHkey Paytr Protocol, a protocol for secure and efficient transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Overview

The ETHkey Paytr Protocol is designed to provide a secure and efficient way to handle transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. It aims to offer a robust solution for managing Ethereum keys, creating and verifying transactions, and ensuring the integrity and security of the protocol.

## Key Features

- **Ethereum Key Generation**: Generate secure Ethereum private and public keys.
- **Transaction Creation**: Create transactions using the Paytr protocol.
- **Transaction Verification**: Verify the integrity and authenticity of transactions.
- **Security**: Ensure the safety and integrity of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Efficiency**: Optimize the performance and scalability of the protocol.
- **Modularity**: Structure the project in a way that allows for easy maintenance and extension.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Crypto library
- secp256k1 library
- js-sha3 library

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:Setland34/ETHkey-Paytr-Protocal.git
   cd ETHkey-Paytr-Protocal
   ```

2. Install Node.js and npm:
   Follow the instructions on the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) to install Node.js and npm.

3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. Configure environment variables (if needed):
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. For example:
   ```sh
   API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

5. Start the project:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

6. Build the project:
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

7. Run tests:

   npm test
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during setup or usage, please refer to the following troubleshooting tips:

1. Ensure that you have the correct version of Node.js and npm installed.
2. Check that all dependencies are installed correctly by running `npm install` again.
3. Verify that your environment variables are set up correctly in the `.env` file.
4. Consult the project's issue tracker on GitHub for any known issues and their solutions.

## Usage Examples and API Documentation

### Generating an Ethereum Key

```js
const { generateKey } = require('./src/ethkey');
const key = generateKey();
console.log('Generated Ethereum Key:', key);
```

### Creating a Paytr Transaction

```js
const { createTransaction } = require('./src/paytr');
const transaction = createTransaction({ from: '0x...', to: '0x...', value: 100 });
console.log('Created Paytr Transaction:', transaction);
```

### Verifying a Transaction

```js
const { verifyTransaction } = require('./src/paytr');
const isValid = verifyTransaction(transaction);
console.log('Is the transaction valid?', isValid);
```

## Running Tests

To run the tests and interpret the results, use the following command:
```sh
npm test
```
