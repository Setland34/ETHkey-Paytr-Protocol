# ETHkey Paytr Protocol

This repository contains the ETHkey Paytr Protocol, a protocol for secure and efficient transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Project Overview and Goals

The ETHkey Paytr Protocol aims to provide a secure and efficient method for conducting transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol leverages advanced cryptographic techniques to ensure the integrity and security of transactions, while also optimizing performance and scalability.

## Key Features

1. **Ethereum Key Generation**: Generate secure Ethereum key pairs using cryptographic algorithms.
2. **Paytr Transactions**: Create and verify transactions using the Paytr protocol.
3. **Transaction Signing**: Sign transactions with private keys to ensure authenticity.
4. **Transaction Verification**: Verify the integrity and authenticity of transactions using public keys.

## Usage Examples

### Generating an Ethereum Key

```js
const { generatePrivateKey, getPublicKey, getAddress } = require('./src/ethkey');

const privateKey = generatePrivateKey();
const publicKey = getPublicKey(privateKey);
const address = getAddress(publicKey);

console.log('Generated Ethereum Key Pair:');
console.log('Private Key:', privateKey);
console.log('Public Key:', publicKey);
console.log('Address:', address);
```

### Creating a Paytr Transaction

```js
const { createTransaction } = require('./src/paytr');

const transaction = createTransaction({
  from: '0xYourAddress',
  to: '0xRecipientAddress',
  value: 100,
});

console.log('Created Paytr Transaction:', transaction);
```

### Verifying a Transaction

```js
const { verifyTransaction } = require('./src/paytr');

const isValid = verifyTransaction(transaction);
console.log('Is the transaction valid?', isValid);
```
